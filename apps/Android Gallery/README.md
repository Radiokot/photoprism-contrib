The app does not (and probably will not) support all the web-client features, but nevertheless it can:
- Provide the library content to other Android apps – you can select PhotoPrism Gallery among other galleries when picking a photo or video
- Open the library content in suitable apps – you can use your favorite image editor or video player instead of web viewer

There are more usefull features in the app, such as chronological fast scroll and search bookmarks.
